                        had for years. After years of teaching reading and math, she 
                        wanted to have a space for children of all ages to visit and 
                        be creative. "Art is an activity that all people need. The process 
                        of starting with a blank slate, going through the process of 
                        creating a piece of art, and seeing a finished product is a 
                        skill that can boost self-confidence and lift the spirit." Anna 
                        hopes that all who enter The Blue House will walk away with an 
                        experience of fun, laughter, and accomplishment. Open Monday-Saturday: 
                        6 AM â€“ 9 PM. Closed Sunday.`}
