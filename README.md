## Mountain Dream

Mountain Dream is an application built to showcase a rental cabin in the mountains of Boone, NC. It uses basic parallax and transform animations. What will stand out is the blog editor for the future implementation of the blog section. The client will be able to maintain their blog without the need of programming. By replicating the basic functions of Google Docs they can create, edit and delete blog articles.

## Motivation

Having a client that enjoys the aesthetics of an application you've created is always a happy feeling. What if you also create an application that allows them to have more power than a regular website? The vision is to give them the ability to self-maintain a portion of their own application. Having a blog for any business helps with customer engagement. Giving the client this power helps them not only keep visibility but boost confidence in you as the developer.
